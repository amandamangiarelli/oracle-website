			<h2>I have had several espresso machines and this is my favorite</h2>
			<h3>Dragon Flyer on September 7th, 2020</h3>
			<img src="images/5stars.png" class="rating" alt="5 out of 5 star rating">
			<p>I have tried several different espresso makers and this is my favorite. My second favorite is Nespresso machines, Tossing away so many capsules bothered me as did the significant increases in Nespresso coffee prices over time. I still use my Nespresso some of the time. The Jura machines made good coffee, but not great coffee. There was little you could control.</p>
			<p>The Oracle machine fills my need for control and my lazy side. Nespresso was super easy and good espresso. What I like even better with the Oracle is that the coffee is noticeably better and almost as easy. </p>
			<p>Like a manual machine, you can control the grind and the tap at will. You can control the water temperature and the timing of each brewing step. That meets my need for control. The easy side is that once you set what you want, the Oracle does it almost automatically. The milk can be done manually or automatically as well. The automatic froth is OK. In a hurry I use it. The manual option can be select with every iteration. </p>

			<h2>Whole New World</h2>
			<h3>Jonathan Rex on September 1st, 2020</h3>
			<img src="images/5stars.png" class="rating" alt="5 out of 5 star rating">
			<p>This is my first real espresso machine and I was in the market for a super-automatic machine originally. My concerns with the super-automatic machines being cleanliness, custom capable, milk steaming, and dealing with milk containers. These concerns are taken care of with the Oracle. Cleaning is simple, customization is easy, and there are no milk containers to keep sanitary.</p>
			<p>However, getting into the espresso world at home may not be for everyone. As I've learned there is a lot of factors that go into a good brew and you'll have to put effort into figuring it out. In the process you'll have some bitter coffee experiences but once the unit is dialed in to the beans you'll love this machine.</p>

			<h2>Specialty Yes, Every Morning No</h2>
			<h3>Aaron Wells on August 24th, 2020</h3>
			<img src="images/4stars.png" class="rating" alt="4 out of 5 star rating">
			<p> This is a well made unit that delivers on the Breville claims reliably. It is not a "set it and forget it" device. The user must maintain to insure usability and function. As for great everyday coffee, James Hoffman's review was most succinct and accurate. He said he did not have enough mental clarity in the morning to spend half an hour to produce his cup of brew. The Oracle does eliminate half to two thirds of the parameters to produce specialty drinks. And with a concerted effort the user can make excellent, repeatable drinks. Just remember that an amateur espresso barista is a hobby requiring a good effort. If you are looking for near perfect espressos, espresso drinks and are willing to develop the method, this Breville is an excellent product. It works well as an integrated unit but a separate grinder would preserve the freshness of the beans. I like mine but I also like my V60, Aeropress and French press for every morning cups.</p>

			<h2>Bad buy, bad design, bad cheap parts.</h2>
			<h3>Anonymous on August 5th, 2020</h3>
			<img src="images/1stars.png" class="rating" alt="1 out of 5 star rating">
			<p>I purchased 3 machines and have recommended the coffee maker to several friends. All 3 of my machines are now not working and one of my friends machine is not working. All of them have the same issue: water pump in the machine sounds like a lawn mower and will not pump water. Here is what I figured out: The machine requires you to clean the machine and prompts you to do so. So you follow the instruction and this is where the pump fails. It gets extremely hot during the clean process and overheats. The pump motor now will require more amps to operate because it was damaged by the over heating process, that kills the water pump. Frother has stopped working on 2 machines. Customer service will play you like a fiddle and you will invest a lot of time getting nowhere. At $2,000 each not a good buy.</p>
			<p>Paid $2,000 for this coffee maker 2 years ago and its now worthless. Breville should not be allowed to take advantage of trusting customers. This is robbery without a gun.</p>

			<h2>Rocky start at first - now I love it.</h2>
			<h3>Clark on July 27th, 2020</h3>
			<img src="images/5stars.png" class="rating" alt="5 out of 5 star rating">
			<p>The more I use this the more I love it. I'll admit when it first arrived I had issues. I set it up according to directions, turned it on and the unit would not heat up above 165 degrees. I let it run for a couple hours and it remained a constant 165. This is an issue since the water must be at 200 before you can use it. I shut it off for the night and turned it on again in the morning. This time it heated to 200 in less that 10 min. I don't know why it didn't heat up after it arrived. Maybe the ambient temperature of the machine had to match that of my house. Not sure.</p>
			<p>It's working great. The coffee is OMG so good. Smooth, rich creamy. I'm using the ground coffee we have in house. Overall it's a great machine, we owned several brands of espresso machines over the year and the flavor from this one beats them all.</p>
